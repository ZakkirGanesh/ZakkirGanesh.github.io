title: Movie Data

It is April 29, 2016, the end of Week 4, and I've now finished two projects in Metis, the first a group project about the use of turnstiles at MTA subway stations, the second an individual project about potential patterns in web-scraped box office data. This is my first time using Python on such a high level, my first time webscraping HTML, and my first time running linear regression tools on Pandas DataFrames.

The next step in my film box-office project is to engage in more manual data entry, to make sure that certain non-numeric features are reliable (making sure that scraping for data does not tell me that "Star Wars: The Force Awakens " is considered an "original screenplay"). Then, I can use that information to start a project on the types of indicators of a film's box office performance, when not based on preexisting intellectual property, not a sequel/remake/reboot, etc.

The most important thing I'm learning is how much being an effective data scientist requires strong domain knowledge. My knowledge of the film industry is stronger experience with data science techniques, which elevates the overall quality of my project. But if I want to run a powerful and effective analysis on the performance of a business, or the efficiency of new consumer technology, I need to learn about topics outside my comfort zone. I can then demonstrate that I'm not just an outsider using numbers without any understanding of the context. This is also what is most exciting to me about the field.
