title: Movie Data

So it's the April 29, 2016, the end of Week 4, and I've now finished two projects in Metis, the first a group project about the use of turnstiles at MTA subway stations, the second an individual project about potential patterns in web-scraped box office data. This is my first time really using Python on such a high level, my first time webscraping HTML, and my first time running linear regression tools on Pandas DataFrames.

The most important thing I'm learning is how much being an effective data scientist requires strong domain knowledge. My knowledge of the film industry is stronger experience with data science techniques, which elevated the overall quality of my project. But if I want to run a powerful and effective analysis on the performance of a business, or the efficiency of new consumer technology, I need to learn about topics outside my comfort zone. I want to be able to demonstrate that I'm not just an outsider using numbers without any understanding of the context. Which brings me to the second thing I've learned well: the bootcamp does not just end in the evening. The day officially ends at 6pm, I've found myself continuing to work on projects and research well up to 9 or 10pm, and in spite of getting only 5 or 6 hours of sleep a night, I still need to find time to keep learning.

More better blog post next time.
