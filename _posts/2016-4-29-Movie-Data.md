So it's the April 29, 2016, the end of Week 4, and I've now finished two projects in Metis, the first a group project about the use of turnstiles at MTA subway stations, the second an individual project about potential patterns in web-scraped box office data. I've never really used Python to this extent before, and now I'm already starting to webscrape HTML (which I really don't understand yet, therefore I fear, therefore I hate), and run one of a few linear regression tools on Pandas DataFrames (which I like less as I learn more).

The most important thing I've learned (at least, on a more molecular level than the purely shrug-worthy semantic level) is how much being able to be an effective data scientist really requires you to have strong domain knowledge. My knowledge of the film industry is stronger than my current skill level or experience with data science techniques, which elevated the overall quality of my project. But what happens once I have to leave my comfort zone and start running analysis on the performance of a business I've never worked in? What happens if I find myself working on a project involving advanced technology I've never worked with? How can I claim to be an expert who can provide reliable information unless I give a strong indication that I know what the information actually means? Its implications?

Four weeks in, I'm becoming acutely aware that despite being a 9am-6pm (or later) experience, I need every spare hour pulling information from every corner of the world, in every field of knowledge or expertise, to make the most of what I learn in Metis itself; the bootcamp doesn't really end in the evening.

More better blog post next time.
